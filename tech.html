  <p> 1. Computing Power 
Computing power has already established its place in the digital era, with almost every device and appliance
 being computerized.
 And it�s here for even more as data science experts have predicted that the computing infrastructure we are
 building right now will only evolve for the better in the coming years. At the same time, we have 5G</p>
<p>2. Robotic Process Automation (RPA)
Like AI and Machine Learning, Robotic Process Automation, or RPA, is another technology that is automating jobs. RPA is the use of software to automate business processes such as interpreting applications, processing transactions, dealing with data, and even replying to emails. RPA automates repetitive tasks that people used to do. </p> 
<p>3. Quantum Computing
Next remarkable technology trend is quantum computing, which is a form of computing that takes advantage of quantum phenomena like superposition and quantum entanglement. This amazing technology trend is also involved in preventing the spread of the coronavirus, and to develop potential vaccines, thanks to its ability to easily query, monitor, analyze and act on data, regardless of the source. Another field where quantum computing is finding applications is banking and finance, to manage credit risk, for high-frequency trading and fraud detection.</p>
